# Pig-Discord-Bot
A Pig Discord Bot that is going to be continuously updated (hopefully). It can send the most recent attachment from subreddits, search Google for a random photo of pigs, and can tell you a funny pig joke. The purpose of this project was to test my Python skills, a long with having some fun with a Discord bot. 

# Technology Used
Replit was used to keep the program running continously. Discord developer was used to create the bot and obtain the token. Google API to run google searches for pig pictures. Reddits' API for grabbing a the most recent attachment from a specified subreddit. 

Language: Python 3.8.12

I have added a requirements.txt file but it may be a little skewed. 
All you need is: 
  pip install discord
  pip install requests
  pip install random
  pip install praw
